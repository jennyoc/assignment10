<h2>Why Adopt?</h2>
    <p>Today, more and more dogs are being abandoned around the country and are goal is to provide as many of these vulnerable animals with safe homes. It is estimated that in the United States, 2.7million cats and dogs are euthanized each year due to so many people giving up their pets and perspective pet owners are not adopting from shelters. Although it is a devestating result, there is not many other options due to the limited space in shelters around the country.</p>
    <p>What many people don't know is that most of the animals at the shelters and rescue centers are very healthy. Most of the time they have been thoroughly examined and given all of the necessary vaccinations before they are available for adoption.</p>
    <p>Although people may want to spend the extra money on a pure-bread puppy, adopting is a much less expensive route to go than buying through a pet store or through a breeder and again as many of these animals have already received examinations and shots, you save money on Vet expenses you would otherwise have to pay.</p>
    <p>Not only will you be adding a new member to your family, but you will be saving this animals life. All that these rescued animals need is love and care and they will give you unconditional love in return. Especially as many dogs have been through such traumatic events, having a loving owner will not only make the pet so happy but will also be very gratifying for you.</p>
