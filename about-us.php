    <h2>About Us</h2>

  <p> Jen and Jenny both have adopted their dogs from local shelters in their hometowns. They believe strongly in adopting dogs from local shelters.
      They hope this website and database will help people looking for a dog in Vermont become a future owner to one of the dogs nearby.
